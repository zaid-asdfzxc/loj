## Quick Start

### Key Combat Mechanics
- Troop Advantages (30% bonus):
  - Bomber > Shooter (damage increase)
  - Shooter > Shield (damage increase)
  - Shield > Bomber (damage reduction)

### Essential Formation Ratios
- Standard Rally (Attack):
  - Shield: 10% (Front line)

  - Shooter: 70% (Back line)

- Standard Defense:
  - Shield: 60% (Front line)
  - Bomber: 30% (Mid line)

### Attack and Defense Plan
1. **Rally Attack**
   - Join Rally Leaders in attack ONLY with Rally Formation ratio
   - Rally leaders can send back troops that don't match the ratio
   
2. **Defense**
   - After successful attack, send troops for defence with Defence formation ratio
   - Garrison leader can send back troops that don't match the ratio
   - Pull out attack troops right before defence reaches the prison to replace attacking troops with defensive troops.
